# FireworkSimulator

This is a project based on **JavaScript** and **WebGL** library, where it simulates how a firework executes.

## How to use:

* Manual: You just need to hold your click, and choose the direction for the firework to follow it. After this, you can release it and watch the fireworks!
* Automatic: If you hit the spacebar, you will watch automatic fireworks! Hit the spacebar again to make it stop.

You can do both things at the same time.

The ones that are "triggering" when going up will have a second explosion.
